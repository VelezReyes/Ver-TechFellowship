# What You Should Expect
We will weekly update this project until the last week of the program. This program is essentially structured towards people who have at least some experience with coding, and throughout the first weeks it will include a lot of Spanish before smoothly transitioning to English-immersed lessons. You are encouraged to use an IDE like Visual Studio Code to complete exercises and future projects; be patient, curious, and enterprising to study the curriculum and find solutions; and cultivate self-discipline and commitment to complete this project. 

While this guide is designed to be self-paced and self-taught, we highly recommend you to set learning goals. Take your time and join us as the next Colombian tech leader.
